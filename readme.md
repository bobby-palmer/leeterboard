# Leeterboard

An automated leaderboard for leetcode progress.

## How to join

Open a new issue with the title: `<leetcode username> <first name> <last name>`
and include the https://github.com/bobby-palmer/leeterboard/labels/register
label.

For example, I would open a new issue titled: "bobbypalmer Bobby Palmer".

Note: the https://github.com/bobby-palmer/leeterboard/labels/register label
should only be used when registering your leetcode account.

## Scoring

1 $\times$ easys solved + 2 $\times$ mediums solved + 3 $\times$ hards solved.
